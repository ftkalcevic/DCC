# DCC Servo Decoder Hardware
The schematic and PCB were designed with Atmel Circuit Studio.  I've read you can load the files using the free version, CircuitMaker.

The PCB is still the original single sided, home made version.  There are 4 jumper wires.  The hole sizes on the copper are small, used as the center mark for drilling.

I really etch PCBs at home anymore, so if I do a version 2.0, this will be a propper, send-out, double sided board.
